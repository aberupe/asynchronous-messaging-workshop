**Running the workshop in your own AWS account**

You can use the **orange arrowheads** on the left and right of the main frame to navigate between the chapters, or the navigation bar in the left frame.

Before we can start, we have to make sure our environment is up and running and current. Just click the **orange arrowheads** on the right to get started.
